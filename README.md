# Power Spectrum Analysis in MATLAB

## Overview
This repository contains my practice files and adapted MATLAB scripts for understanding and analyzing power spectrum data.

- **`matlab_code/`**: Contains MATLAB scripts for performing power spectrum analysis.
- **`data/`**: Example data used for testing the power spectrum analysis code.
- **`documentation/`**: Notes and information about the scripts and data (optional).

## Getting Started
- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/HANNAH-LEE-LY/PowerSpec.git`
- Open MATLAB and navigate to the `matlab_code/` directory.
- Run the scripts to see the power spectrum analysis in action.

## Acknowledgments
The scripts in this repository were adapted from the MathWorks documentation for the `pspectrum` function. Original source: [MathWorks pspectrum Documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/pspectrum.html).
